<h1>Egg and tomato</h1>

<div id="tagline">A classic chinese home dish for children that will help you make dispora friends.</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>
	<li>garlic</li>
	<li>5 medium tomatoes, cut into segments</li>
	<li> ginger</li>
	<li> <div id="imagewords">4 eggs <img id="img1" src="../assets/img/eggs.png" alt=""></div></li></br>
	<li> <div id="imagewords">soy <img id="img1" src="../assets/img/light-soy.png" alt=""></div></li></br>
	<li>sugar </li>
	<li>oil</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>

	 <li>fry egg a la <a href="../recipes/egg-fried-rice.html">egg-fried rice</a> (a broken up omelette), by whisking 3-4 eggs well before pouring them in a hot pan with a splash of oil. Allow the mixture to fry up but not to brown, stirring it around to fold the cooked egg over the uncongealed liquid parts, until it's all cooked. Put cooked egg back into the container you mixed it in.</li>
	 <li>Now put pan back onto moderate heat, hopefully without too much egg stuck on it. Optionally: fry a little bit of ginger and spring onion with little oil. Put the chopped tomatoes in the pan, allow these to gently fry and soften in the oil.</li> 
	 <li>After around 7 minutes, add a splash of soy sauce (but not enough to turn everything brown), a pinch of salt and a tablespoon or more of sugar. Taste it, it should be both sweet and savory.</li>
	 <li>Add the egg to the tomato pan, and stir/cook for a couple of minute until it's warm and well-combined. Serve with white rice.</li>
