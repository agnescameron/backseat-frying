<div id="tagline">palestinian chicken upside-down cake. a celebration meal.</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>an aub (or a few chinese aubs)</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
<li>1 cauliflower (optional)</li>
<li>a few waxy potatoes (2 bigs or 4 smalls)</li>
<li>enough chicken pieces to line the pot (you can make this vegetarian too)</li>
<li>a few cups of rice (ideally Calrose rice, but can use sushi or basmati)</li>
<li>wheat vermicelli</li>
<li>allspice</li>
<li>cumin powder</li>
<li>turmeric</li>
<li>cloves</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>bay leaves</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>make a stock by simmering the chicken with bay leaves, a quartered onion, and a celery stick and carrot if you have them spare. simmer for around 30 mins, enough to make a flavourful stock without overcooking the chicken</li>
<li>meanwhile, cut the vegetables (carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, aubergine) into ~1/4 inch discs, and fry each separately in olive oil. once they brown, set aside, and fry the next batch.</li>
<li>line the bottom of the pot you're using with the fried potatoes, then on top of that layer the chicken. Add the rest of the vegetables in layers on top of that, then cover with about an inch of rice. cover the rice with stock by a knuckle or so, and cook the whole thing on a medium heat for about half an hour, making sure the rice doesn't run out of water </li>
<li>when the rice is cooked, find a plate or other surface that's larger than the pan. place it on top of the pan, then flip the whole thing. for the full effect, put it on top of your head and tap it for an audience (everyone say 'oooo'). to serve, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and toasted slivered almonds if you're really feeling fancy</li>
</ol>
