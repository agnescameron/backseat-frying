<h1>dosa</h1>

<div id="tagline">cranchy lentil pancake (cheat version)</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups rice flour</li>
<li>3/4 cup urad dal flour</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>mix the flours with a pinch of salt, and 2 1/2 cups water, into a moderately-thin batter. Leave in a warm place to ferment for a few hours (at least 5, preferably overnight)
</li>
<li>heat a cast-iron pan. Take the half onion and spear it on a fork, using it to spread the oil between dosas. You don't *need* to do this, but they definitely stick less when you do</li>
<li>once the pan is really hot, ladle a spoon of batter in, then spread it out in spirals with the back of a spoon. flip when the underside is brown and crispy, and remove from the pan when the other side has brown spots. Dip the half-onion in oil, smear around the pan, and repeat</li>
</ol>
These can be tricky and sticky, so it's good to make sure your pan is in good shape before you start. Scour of all the debris, and season the pan with oil. The onion really helps, and make sure to clear out any debris before starting another dosa.

Serve this with <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/potato-masala.html">potato masala</a> and pickles.
