<div id="parts">
<ul>
	<li>greens</li>
	<li> garlic</li>

<div id="instructions"><ol>

	 <li>chop a garlic clove or 2, and wash the greens</li>
	 <li>heat oil in the wok until it shimmers, then put the garlic in and fry till it starts to sizzle (you want the oil to get the flavour but you don't want it to go brown)
	</li> 	
	 <li>put in the greens, add soy or salt and a little bit of water, put a lid on the pan to steam soft if they're big. important that the pan's not too full, and everything cooks really hot.
	</li> 

</ol>
Depending on how tough your greens are, you might want more oil or less water. For a drier, tougher green like kale or spring greens (aka collard greens) I tend to use more oil and a drier pan, with a small splash of water going in right at the end and maybe not even a lid on top, as they have the structure to take a good fry. For softer, wetter greens like pak choi, lettuce, chinese cabbage or water spinach, add the water along with the greens, lid steam, and cook the juices off.
