<h1>flatbread</h1>

<div id="tagline">fire bread!! can also be <span style="font-size: 12px">stove bread</span> if you're having a quiet one</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>bread flour (I use white but you could use wholemeal)</li>
<li>tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>tsp salt</li>
<li>tbsp yeast</li>
<li>cumin seeds</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>mix together the bread flour, yeast, salt, cumin and olive oil with a pinch of sugar, and enough warm water to make a soft dough. knead for 5 minutes or so, until you can feel the glutens stretching and doing their thing. leave in a warm place to rise for at least half an hour, preferably an hour or more. 
</li>
<li>knead again, and check that the dough is risen. use your fingers to push the bread into rough rounds, not too thick or they won't cook inside. stack together, with plenty of flour to stop them sticking</li>
<li> heat the cast iron pan on the fire or the stove over a high heat. drizzle with olive oil (you don't need too much), and put the bread in. it should start to puff up in places, and brown on one side. flip until it's cooked through.</li>
</ol>
serve with <a href="baba-ganoush.html">noosh</a>, and <a href="fellahi-salad.html">assorted</a> <a href="garlic-potato-salad.html">salads</a>. you could also swap out the cumin seeds with caraway seeds for a scandi feel (have with fish, dill and nice butter), with za'tar and oil for a palestinian breakfast, or with nigella seeds and serve with a curry.
