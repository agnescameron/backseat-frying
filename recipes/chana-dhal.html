<h1>chana dhal</h1>

<div id="tagline">slow salad for the cold winter</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>a few cups of chana dhal (yellow split peas)</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>ginger</li>
<li>chillies</li>
<li>coriander (leaves)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp coriander (seeds)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cumin (seeds)</li>
<li>1-2 tomatoes (optional)</li>
<li>turmeric</li>
<li>chilli powder</li>
<li>garam masala</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>if you're feeling organised, put the chana dhal in a big bowl of water to soak for a couple of hours. this isn't essential, but will speed up the cooking a lot.
</li>
<li>put the chana dhal in a big pan, and cover with twice as much water, then a lid. add in 1/2-1tsp turmeric, and bring to the boil. (this bit could be done much faster in a pressure cooker)</li>
<li>turn down the heat, and simmer the dhal until soft. if you didn't soak this part takes about 1 hour.</li>
<li>now to make the tarka: very finely chop the onions, and fry over a low heat till translucent</li>
<li>add in chopped ginger and garlic, fry some more, then add cumin coriander chilli powder and garam masala. fry fry fry, then add in the tomatoes</li>
<li>once the tomatoes have cooked down, stir the tarka into the dhal. add salt to taste</li>
</ol>
this recipe also works well with red lentils, which are a lot faster to cook (about 20 mins, rather than an hour). The chana dhal have a really lovely nutty taste though, and maintain their shape and texture a bit better when cooked, so if you have the time I think it's worth it. serve with white rice and a pickle!
