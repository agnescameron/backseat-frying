<h2>spicy potato pancake</h2>

<div id="tagline">aloo there</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>2 or 3 potatoes</li>
<li>2 or 3 bay leaves</li>
<li>2 cups flour</li>
<li>stock of some kind (if you do this properly, 2 pig's feet)</li>
<li>1 small (sweet, if poss) onion</li>
<li>finely diced shallot</li>
<li>finely chopped coriander leaves</li>
<li>chopped green finger chillies</li>
<li>amchoor powder</li>
<li>garam masala powder</li>
<li>chilli powder</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>
	chop the potatoes, and boil in salted water until really soft
</li>
<li>
	first, start on the dough: add a pinch of salt, and fold in warm water, kneading gently till you have a soft, smooth dough. You can use plain or wholewheat flour for this (I think wholewheat is traditional, but plain is fine). Leave to rest for 20 minutes or so.
</li>
<li>
	Once the potatoes are really soft, mash them, adding in the minced shallots, coriander, chillies and spices, with salt to taste. It's really important that these are very small! If they're chunky you'll have problems with rolling out.
</li>
<li>
	Turn out the dough onto an oiled surface, and divide into small balls. Roll each into a circle about 5 inches across. 
</li>
<li>
	Spoon potato mix into the middle of the round, leaving a little space around the edges. Place another round on top, and firmly press the edges together. Roll it out with a rolling pin (you will be surprised how thin you can get this) to almost the same diameter of your pan, or until the dough is almost breaking.
</li>

<li>
	Heat a teaspoon of oil in a cast-iron pan, and when smoking, add in the first paratha. Brush the top side with oil and flip, repeating till both sides are crisp and brown in patches. Do all of them then eat hot!
</li>
</ol>
This is surprisingly fast to make, and deeply comforting and rewarding. The amchoor (sour mango) powder is really important: the sour note lifts this from being a little stodgy (though if you don't have any, just go hard on the pickles). Good by itself with a little pickle, transcendent accompanied by a little bowl of dal and some yoghurt, too.<br><br>
If you have leftover potato mix, it makes a great packed lunch with some pickles, a boiled egg, and some steamed greens. Leftover parathas are great too, zap them in the microwave though.
