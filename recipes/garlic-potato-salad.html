<h1>garlic potato salad</h1>

<div id="tagline">we ate this a lot in palestine. its name in arabic is <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">كالثوم</span> (kalthum), which literally means 'garlicky'. it's stretching 'salad' a bit and it might sound like a lot to eat this with bread, but it's also delicious</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>white potatoes (more floury than waxy is best)</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>garlic (at least 6 cloves)</li>
<li>sumac (optional)</li>
<li>parsley (optional)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>boil the potatoes in a pan till they're soft, and crumble when you poke them with a fork. you probably don't need to peel them: just scrub them hard before you put them in to thin the skin.
</li>
<li>mash with salt, oil and minced garlic. go for it with the olive oil, as it gives a lot of flavour. Top with sumac and/or minced parsley, and another drizzle of olive oil.</li>
</ol>
really good served with <a href="flatbread.html">flatbread</a>, and accompanied by other, more salady salads.
