<h1>baingan masala</h1>

<div id="tagline">goodbye to your afternoon hello to a delicious dish. involves blender.</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>some little aubs (6-7 little indian ones best but if you can't find, 2-3 chinese aubs are OK. big spongy guys are out.)</li>
<li>6 tbsp unsweetened dessicated coconut</li>
<li>2 tbsp white sesame seeds</li>
<li>3 tbsp peanuts</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>ginger</li>
<li>green chillies</li>
<li>coriander (leaves)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp coriander (seeds)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cumin (seeds)</li>
<li>1-2 tomatoes</li>
<li>turmeric</li>
<li>chilli powder</li>
<li>garam masala</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>chop the aubergines into chunks, and put in a bowl of very salty water. leave to sit.
</li>
<li>put the coconut, sesame seeds and peanuts into a blender with the coriander seeds and cumin seeds. whiz in short bursts (you don't want the oil to start coming out of the nuts), until the mixture is fine and powdery.</li>
<li>very finely chop the onion, and fry over a low heat until translucent and starting to brown. add in chopped ginger and garlic, and fry gently for another couple of minutes</li>
<li>add in the blended nuts and spices, and fry until golden brown. this bit smells really wonderful.</li>
<li>add in the chopped tomato, and stir, adding water if it starts to stick. cook this part for about 10min, or until the tomato is soft</li>
<li>add in 1/2 tsp turmeric and chilli powder, and a tsp garam masala, along with a tablespoon of chopped coriander leaves and chopped green chillies. stir the whole thing really well to distribute the spices</li>
<li>drain and add the aubs, stirring to coat in the mixture. add water to the whole mixture, turn the heat up, and put the lid on it</li>
<li>cook until the aubs are really soft, adding water to keep it relatively soupy (you don't want to serve this too dry)</li>
</ol>
