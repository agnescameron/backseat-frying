<h1>caramelised almonds</h1>

<div id="tagline">nuts for days! molten sugar is not only very hot, but very sticky.</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>two spoonfuls of butter (optional for butter taste)</li>
<li>five tablespoons or so of granulated sugar (white sugar is good, brown is fine too but nothing too coarse so it melts evenly)</li>
<li><div id="imagewords">three big handfuls (e.g. 250g) of almonds<img id="img1" src="../assets/img/almond.png" alt="" /></li><br>
<li> sprinkle of salt</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li> lay out a bit of baking paper, or else ready a smooth heatproof surface like a place.
<li> heat a skillet or any wide pan, a less sticky one is easier.
<li> melt the butter without burning it, turn the heat to medium-low if you're at risk.
<li> scatter sugar in the pan in an even layer
<li> don't interfere with the sugar; watch it slowly melt to a caramel, adjusting the position of the heat if one side is melting too quickly â€“ it must melt evenly without burning. This should take about 3-4min.
<li> once the sugar into a scalding hot golden brown ooze, or at the first sight of any sugar smoking/burning, stir all the nuts and coat them well in caramel. The nuts will also help to cool down any burning sugar before it becomes a black gooey mess.
<li> add a generous sprinkle of salt into the mix if you like that sort of thing.
<li> after the nuts are well coated - 10 seconds should do it - tip them out onto your surface and spread them evenly with a spatula while the caramel is soft. it will be brittle soon.
<li>  fill the (hot) pan with water so the caramel dissolves off cleanly. let the almonds cool before breaking them up.
<li> once cooled, store them in an airtight container. don't store them while their still warm or the condensation will make them sticky.
