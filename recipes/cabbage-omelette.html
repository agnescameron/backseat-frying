there's a bit of an art to frying the chinese cabbage - you want the cabbage to be soft but you don't want it to overcook: it'll release lots of water into the pan, start to steam instead of fry, and then the eggs won't be so nice. so - as soon as it's soft, put the eggs in, and make sure the pan's hot and not too full (to make sure the cabbage fries instead of steams).
