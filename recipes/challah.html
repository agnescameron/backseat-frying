<h1>challah</h1>
<h2>the C is soft yet present</h2>

<div id="tagline">Not all Chosen carbs are flat. Here comes the bread.</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>8-9 cups flour</li>
<li>5 eggs</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar or honey</li>
<li>2 1/4 cups warm water</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>1/2 cup veggie oil</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>Wake up the yeast. Put it in a bowl with the water and stir it vigorously and then leave it alone for 10 mins
</li>
<li>Mix up 4 eggs and oil and salt and the sugar/honey. And sometimes I add way extra honey because people think they have sophisticated palates but really everyone wants sweet warm bread.</li>
<li>Combine the bowls and add the flour slowly. Knead it a whole bunch until you can feel the dough get smooth and stretchy. </li>
<li>Leave it alone in a bowl covered with saran wrap for 3 hours. It will get huge.</li>
<li>Come back, push the dough down flat, give it soft baby punches.</li>
<li>Cut it in half--each of these halves will make a loaf. You can even cut it in fourths and make four small loaves.</li>
<li>Then separate these lumps into three littler lumps and roll them into strands. Braid each. Just like hair. Oil them a bit. Leave them covered on a baking sheet for another hour.</li>
<li>Heat the oven to 390F. Baste the challah with the remaining egg, let it soak for 5 mins, put some salt and sugar on the crust for fun, and send it (this is a euphemism for beginning the bake).</li>
<li>After like 25 mins take a look. I like it undercooked and squishy. If squish authorities are watching then leave it in for 40.</li>
</ol>
What to say about Challah. Like beat poetry or fractal visions it only gets more beautiful when torn asunder. This lesson may save you someday. It is soft and it dips well in salt or fat and you can roll it into little balls and catch catfish with it you can clean your plate and even celebrate your exodus. Best eaten in large chatty groups.

Recipe courtesy of one adam haar-horowitz, backseat frying's raison d'etre. We do not condone any of the squishy activities recommended within, and would insted like to remind everyone of the guidelines clearly set out <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-DJ">on the squishy authorities' website</a>. Thanks, mods.
