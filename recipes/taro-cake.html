<h1>taro cake</h1>
<h2>wu tao gou</h2>

<div id="tagline">"this is meatloaf, this is what meatloaf is" -- gary zhexi zhang</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>taro (5 little guys or one big guy)</li>
<li>spring onions</li>
<li>1 cup rice flour (not glutinous)</li>
<li>dried mushrooms</li>
<li>dried shrimp</li>
<li>chinese bacon</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>cut the taro into chunks and place it in a steamer. steam for about 30 minutes, or until soft and light purple
</li>
<li>soak the dried mushrooms and shrimp till soft, and hold on to the soaking water.</li>
<li>finely dice the chinese bacon, and fry it in a pan till starting to brown. add in the finely diced spring onions, then once they've cooked a little, the (you guessed it) finely diced mushrooms and shrimp</li>
<li>peel and mash the steamed taro, and mix in the bacon/onion/mushroom mixture, with some salt.</li>
<li>mix the rice flour into the water you saved from the mushroom soaking, then mix that into the taro. it should be thick and squishy.</li>
<li>spoon all of that into a tin (loaf tin ideal, you could use a bowl if you've not got anything else), and place that inside a steamer. We balanced a loaf tin on a rack inside a pot of water, and that worked well</li>
<li>steam for 1 hour (remember to top up the water often!!), and it will gently coagulate into a soft, springy loaf. leave to cool</li>
<li>slice the loaf into thick slices and fry it up! serve with oyster sauce and spring onions. it is soooo gooood</li>
</ol>

this is an amazing food in that once you have the loaf you can just slice and fry it whenever. extremely homogenous. slices on demand. it's really great, particularly as a hangover breakfast. we've been eating this too quickly to test, but am sure it freezes well.<br><br>

we've not done this cause we don't have any, but dried scallops also feature in most recipes for this dish so if you have some, include them! we also used the bacon that toby cured in this which was particularly delicious.<br><br>

for someone who has never eaten meatloaf, gary has a lot of opinions about it.
