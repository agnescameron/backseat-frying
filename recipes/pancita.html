<h2>(mexican tripe soup)</h2>

<div id="tagline">tripe hype</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>a sheet or 2 of tripe (I like book tripe, honeycomb is good too)</li>
<li>2 or 3 bay leaves</li>
<li>stock of some kind (if you do this properly, 2 pig's feet)</li>
<li>1 small (sweet, if poss) onion</li>
<li>garlic garlic</li>
<li><div id="imagewords">2 or 3 dry guajillo chillies<img id="img1" src="../assets/img/guajillo.png" alt=""></div></li></br>
<li>coriander leaves</li>
<li>lime</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>
	First, you need to deal with the tripe smell (and, if using pig feet, the pork smell too). Put both in a large pot, and bring to the boil. Go hard for 10min, then drain and slice the tripe. I tend to slice the tripe into long, thin pieces when using book tripe, and chunkier half-inch sections when using honeycomb.
</li>
<li>
	Put the tripe (+ feet) back in the pan with bay leaves, and bring to a simmer. If no feet, add the stock here. (this is the part where I added squash chunks too)
</li>
<li>
	Soak the dried chillies in water till soft. Blend, along with 1/2 the onion, cumin, garlic and salt, into a potent red paste. Add to the soup, and simmer for about a half hour. Season with salt and oregano.
</li>
<li>
	Serve topped with the rest of the onion, diced, coriander leaves and a squeeze of lime.
</li>
</ol>
This soup is complicated and spicy and chewy and smoky, and goes well with simple things like fried fish, boiled eggs, boiled potatoes and fried greens. Last time I made this, I added a chunked acorn squash, which added a nice sweet flavour to the smoky chillies. Haven't made this with the pig foot stock yet, but I imagine it to be delicious.
