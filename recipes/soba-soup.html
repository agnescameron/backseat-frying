</ul>

<div id="instructions"><ol>

	 <li>heat water in a pan and add in a glug each of mirin, sake and soy, along with a teaspoon of dashi powder and the wakame (wakame really expands, so start with a pinch and add more if you like).
	</li>
	<li>
 in a different pan, bring water to the boil and cook the noodles in lots of water, for around 4 minutes. drain, cover in the soup base, and add toppings.</li>
	 
	 <li>if you're looking to impress anyone (even just yourself), as you're putting the noodles into the bowl, use chopsticks to pick them up in a straight sheet, and fold them at the bottom before pouring on the stock. it's simple but makes the dish surprisingly sexy.
	</li>

</ol>
itâ€™s nice to add fried, crispy stuff to this soup, otherwise it can feel a bit virtuous. traditionally this is tempura, but a fried egg is good too.
