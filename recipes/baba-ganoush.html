<li>tahini</li>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
<li>punch the aubergine full of small holes with a fork to stop it from bursting, and put it on a fire wrapped in tinfoil, or loose on a baking tray in the oven with the heat all the way up. wait until it's totally soft and floppy on all sides (this takes a while, like 30min at least in the oven).
</li>
<li>if you're doing this in the oven, take the cooked aubergine and hold it over a gas flame for 30 seconds or so on each side to get the smoky flavour from the fire</li>
<li>gently scrape out the flesh from inside the aubergine. this should be easy, and the flesh should be soft and grey-brown: if it's still stiff and white, it's not cooked enough. don't worry about getting little bits of skin in the mix as they add flavour</li>
<li> mash with a fork, and add in chopped garlic, tahini, chilli, oil and lemon. make sure to add lots of salt as this brings all the flavours out. if you like, chop parsley on top.</li>
