<li>bring a pan of water to the boil, and add the noodles. I like to use the thick rice noodles as they're satisfyingly chewy, but this dish works equally well with the thinner <span id="imagewords" style="float: unset">chinese wheat noodles <img id="img1" src="../assets/img/chinese-noodle.jpg" alt=""></span> (though if you're having this as a packed lunch, they can get a bit sticky during a day in the fridge). In an ideal world this is made with hand-pulled noodles (chewy <i>and</i> wheaty), but that's a lot of effort. Don't overcook them: you want them to still have some bounce. After draining them, rinse well with cold water, until they're cool.
</li>
<li>slice the cucumber lengthways into <i>very</i> thin strips with a sharp knife. finely chop the coriander and spring onions, and mix with the noodles. dress with sesame oil, laoganma and light soy, and mix well. sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
</ol>
makes a great packed lunch with a <a href="tea-egg.html">tea egg</a>. also good to add are steamed greens, <span id="imagewords" style="float: unset">aburaage<img id="img1" src="../assets/img/aburaage.png" alt=""></span>, bean sprouts, or toasted peanuts.
