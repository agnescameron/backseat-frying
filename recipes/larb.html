<div id="tagline">lao meat salad! (very delicious)</div>
<div id="parts">
<ul>

<li>a pound or so minced pork, beef or chicken</li>
<li> <div id="imagewords">fish sauce <img id="img1" src="../assets/img/fish-sauce.jpg" alt=""></div></li><br/>
<li>3 or 4 small shallots</li>
<li>1 tbsp uncooked rice</li>
<li>thai basil</li>
<li>coriander</li>
<li>mint</li>
<li>spring onions</li>
<li>chopped finger chillies</li>
<li>1 or 2 limes</li>
<li>chilli powder (optional)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions"><ol>
	<li>put the uncooked rice in a dry wok, and toast until golden brown.</li>
	<li>zap the toasted rice to a coarse powder with the blender (you can also use a mortar and pestle)</li>
	<li>before you start frying, it's worth getting the shallots chopped first, because they can be small and fiddly (you want the little guys the big ones aren't so flavourful). cut them into small slices + do the same for the spring onions</li>
	<li>heat some veg oil in a wok, and add in the meat. fry until it browns, adding in some chilli powder if you like.</li>
	<li>add in the ground toasted rice, lime juice, fish sauce, and a pinch of sugar.</li>
	<li> fry another minute, then add in chillies, shallots, basil, mint and coriander. have a taste, add more of anything you like, then remove from the heat </li>
</ol>

Serve this on lettuce leaves, and/or with rice. To make the lettuce leaves crispy, soak them in icy water first. This goes well with a tom yum soup or an omelette.
