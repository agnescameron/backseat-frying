	<h2>03.11.2020  <br> supermarket special: agnes and louis in sunset park </h2>

Louis came to visit from the UK! At a crazy time! Having stopped getting the subway at that point, we took a walk to sunset park to enjoy the supermarkets. In particular, we were there to visit the wonderful <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fei+Long+Market/@40.6343639,-74.0130566,17.3z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24549241bd617:0xb2eed95bd7396ec7!8m2!3d40.6333333!4d-74.0113889">Fei Long Supermarket</a>, a temple to nice things in jars and posessed of 4 self-serve <i>tripe buckets</i>, each filled with a different stomach. (been getting into tripe lately, but more on that in later posts. i go for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omasum">'book tripe'</a>, if anyone's curious)<br><br>

It's a long walk there from our house though, so we stopped on the way into a Mexican corner shop at the bottom corner of Evergreen cemetary. I picked up some corn husks (to make tamales, as per the last post), but we were also thrilled to find arroz con leche ice lollies in the freezer! <br><br>

Frozen rice pudding on a stick is great: who knew! They were filled with a generous dusting of raisins and cinnamon... pleasantly chalky, not too sweet. Really really good.
