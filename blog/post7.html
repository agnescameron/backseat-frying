	<h2>03.24.2020  <br> adding snacks </h2>

Added a backlog of recipes today, namely <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/pancita.html">pancita</a> (a mexican tripe soup), <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/seema-vankaya-pappu.html">seema vankaya pappu</a> (chayote dal), <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/dosa.html">dosa</a>, <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/cabbage-thoran.html">cabbage thoran</a>, and <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/aloo-paratha.html">aloo paratha</a> (a potato pancake). Pancita I made pretty recently after an impulse tripe purchase, while the seema vankaya pappu and aloo paratha I've made a few times now, mostly together.<br><br>

We've been making more indian food lately, after I worked with a dancer based near Journal Square in Jersey City, which has a high concentration of indian supermarkets and restaurants. In particular, I tried making aloo paratha after a really amazing meal at <a href="https://www.mithaas.com/">Mithaas</a>, which served it with a delicious dhal and a series of pickles and chutneys.<br><br>

Before everything shut down, every time I went over I had been buying most of the indian ingredients from a supermarket nearby called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Big+Bazar+supermarket/@40.7349288,-74.0664284,17.09z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2572fc393e653:0x5bcca14f29bfd217!8m2!3d40.7356561!4d-74.0662669">Big Bazar</a>. I've also been to Apna Bazar Cash and Carry, and Patel Brothers on the same street: they're good, but Big Bazar is just a bit bigger, get a load of that pickle section!
