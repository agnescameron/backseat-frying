	<h2>03.03.2020  <br> nyc snack watch: york street station tamales </h2>

Lately I've been going to the navy yard a bunch to work on some ash-sprinkling machines, and (a corollary) I've also been eating too many bagels. It's a bit of a snack desert.<br><br>

I headed there early this morning to do some soldering, and was kind of regretting not eating breakfast, when I stepped out the station to find a tamale stand! (I hadn't seen it there before, but I'd also never got there at 8:40am, perhaps that's a good time!).<br><br>

I got a cheese tamale (tamale de rajas con queso), and then walked to wegman's bar to wash my hands (1. can't be too careful, 2. wegman's has a bar, lol). It's been getting pretty sunny so I ate it outside, a joy in itself. <i>What a lovely tamale!</i> Soft, tender, a reasonable amount of cheese, with hot salsa and a roasted poblano pepper. A wonderful leaf breakfast, kinda sad I didn't get more than one. <br><br>

Watch this space for backseat frying tamale attempts (<a href="https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/tamales-de-rajas-con-queso/">this recipe</a> looks promising).<br><br>
