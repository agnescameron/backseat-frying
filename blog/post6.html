	<h2>03.22.2020  <br> ravioli party </h2>

We made some squash ravioli last night, and it was really lovely! A nice thing to do if you're stuck at home and, apart from eggs (and cheese/parmesan if you include it, you don't have to) it can be made only with storecupboard ingredients.

The long part is really kneading and rolling out the dough: it's stiff and springy, which made it hard to work into thin sheets. The trick is swapping between sheets as you roll, so you wait for them to dry out a little and lose some elasticity. We wrote up the recipe <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/recipes/ravioli.html">here</a>
