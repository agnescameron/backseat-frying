<h1>good websites</h1>

<div>
	We have a few cooking websites that we like a lot, and turn to in times of stress or in search of new foods.
	
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://thewoksoflife.com"><i>The Woks of Life:</i></a> This is maybe our favourite food site. It's a family-run blog with an amazing range of chinese recipes (well-indexed), they're very funny, and they're also <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-lard/">really enthusiastic about lard.</a> All of their recipes work great, too.

	<br><br>
	<a href="https://haifazaitoon.wixsite.com/inkitchenwithhaifa"><i>In the Kitchen With Haifa:</i></a> Sahar's mum has a food site! It's <i>really really good</i>, but also only in Arabic (there are lots of process pictures though, and google's 'translate this page' works fine). In particular, check out the <a href="https://haifazaitoon.wixsite.com/inkitchenwithhaifa/recipes/category/%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%8A">stuffed foods (hebronite speciality)</a>, and the <a href="https://haifazaitoon.wixsite.com/inkitchenwithhaifa/recipes/category/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA">homemade juices</a>.

	<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.foodjimoto.com"><i>Foodjimoto:</i></a> Similar to Woks of Life, it's a sweet family cooking blog with a big range, japanese + japanese-american food. Not currently being updated (since 2014), and harder to search for recipes, but nice to read.

	<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com"><i>Just One Cookbook:</i></a> This is a good japanese food site, not very homey but really huge range of recipes, clear instructions, and well-laid out.

	<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com"><i>Korean Bapsang:</i></a> Really nice Korean-American mum cooking blog, big range of recipes, great soups and pickles.

	<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.lindasitaliantable.com"><i>Linda's Italian Table:</i></a> Italian american food blog with a frankly wild aesthetic. We've yet to explore this one in depth but it's where the salt cod stew recipe came from, and has a good line in seafood generally. She has a book out called <a href="http://www.lindasitaliantable.com/for-love-of-crostinithe-book/">'for love of crostini'</a>

	<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nigelslater"><i>Nigel Slater:</i></a> Publishes weekly recipes in the guardian, and has done for years -- so there's a huge range. Really wonderful food writer, and very good to turn to if you need to roast a meat. (nice cakes too)

	<br><br>
	<a href=https://www.maangchi.com><i>Maangchi:</i></a> Korean cooking blog run by a woman called Maangchi, with a huge range of recipes (in particular for <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipes/banchan"><i>banchan</i></a>, or side dishes). She's makes a lot of youtube cooking videos, and also her logo is a drawing of her holding a fish and a cleaver. Big on pickles.
